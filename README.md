# WeRelateWikidataAlignment
A python script that compares and contrasts genealogy information across WeRelate and Wikidata

The author is rather more proud of what this script does and has helped to do - than he is the way it does it!

The script is able to compare WeRelate content with Wikidata claims for mother, father, spouse, partner, child and sibling.
At present, the sibling comparison has been commented out.  The other claims are more critical to establishing larger
contiguous genealogy graphs.  Further - even with sibling claim differences omitted, the difference report is almost unmanageably
large (over 30,000 lines).
